                      Dataset: We want to work with the facebook dataset

Our Goal: We want to explore what statistic relates to the amount of likes, time a user has spent on the platform, and gender. We are trying to explore which of these areas is most likely going to influence whether and user will have increased traffic to their profile and postings. At the end of our research and after cleaning our dataset, we hope to prove whether or not time, age, or gender have an influence on your presense on facebook.
