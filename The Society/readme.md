                      Dataset: We want to work with the facebook dataset

Our Goal: We want to explore what statistic relates to the amount of likes a user is given based off of their demographics primarily dealing with age/friend_count/friendships and gender. We are trying to explore which of these areas is most likely going to influence whether and user will have increased traffic to their profile and postings. At the end of our research after cleaning our dataset, we hope to prove whether or not age and friend_count and gender have an influence on your presense on facebook. 

**This information is solely based on Facebook's social media platform and not others such as Twitter,Instagram,TikTok,etc..
